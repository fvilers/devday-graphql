# devday-graphql
The sample used during my GraphQL presentation at DevDay 2017

## How to run this sample ?

Clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the `start:dev` script.

```
npm install
npm run start:dev
```

Then, browse to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/graphql).

## How to change the default port ?
If you'd like to change the default port, set an environment variable named `PORT` to any other value to suit your needs then start the server.
